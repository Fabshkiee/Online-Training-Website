                <h2>What is Online Training?</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Online Training</b>, also known as e-learning, computer-based training (CBT), or distance
                    learning, is a modern form of education delivered entirely via the internet. It leverages multimedia
                    elements such as videos, images, audio, and interactive tools, making learning engaging and
                    accessible. Unlike traditional classroom settings, online training offers flexibility, allowing
                    learners to study at their own pace and from any location.
                    <br><br>
                    The internet provides an abundance of educational resources, accommodating diverse learning styles.
                    From self-paced courses to live virtual sessions, online training has become a popular and effective
                    way to acquire new knowledge and skills, whether for personal growth or professional development.
                    <br><br>
                    Online training is offered in various formats, from video tutorials and webinars to fully immersive
                    virtual environments. It is used across different fields, from academic subjects to practical skills
                    like coding, design, or language learning. Many programs also include certifications, helping
                    learners validate their expertise and improve career prospects.

                <h2>Is Online Training Safe?</h2>
                <p>
                    Online training is generally safe, as most reputable platforms implement measures to ensure the
                    security and quality of their content. Learners can access valuable resources, interact with
                    experts, and gain knowledge in a structured and reliable manner.
                    <br><br>
                    However, not all online training sites adhere to high standards of professionalism or accuracy.
                    Informal training sites like YouTube provide an extensive collection of tutorials on topics ranging
                    from troubleshooting to programming and job preparation.
                    <br><br>
                    While YouTube's community-based ratings, such as likes, dislikes, and subscribes, help filter out
                    low-quality content, these features don't always guarantee accuracy or reliability. It is crucial to
                    verify the credibility of content creators, as informal platforms lack the rigorous quality control
                    seen in formal training sites.
